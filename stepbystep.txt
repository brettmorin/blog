  $ geany features/view_home_page.feature
  - re-factor to change wording
    Feature: View Home Page
      Scenario:  Home page should say "Blog Home"
        When I visit the home page
        Then I should see "Blog Home"
  $ geany features/step_definitions/home_page_steps
  - re-factor
    require File.expand_path(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), "..", "support", "paths"))

    When /^I view the home page$/ do |page_name|
      visit path_to(page_name)
    end

    Then /^I should see "([^\"]*)"$/ do |text|
      page.should have_content(text)
    end
  $ touch features/support/paths.rb
  $ geany features/support/paths.rb
    module NavigationHelpers
      def path_to(page_name)
        case page_name
     
        when /the home\s?page/
          '/'
        else
          begin
            page_name =~ /the (.*) page/
            path_components = $1.split(/\s+/)
            self.send(path_components.push('path').join('_').to_sym)
          rescue Object => e
            raise "Can't find mapping from \"#{page_name}\" to a path.\n" +
              "Now, go and add a mapping in #{__FILE__}"
          end
        end
      end
    end

    World(NavigationHelpers)
  $ cucumber
